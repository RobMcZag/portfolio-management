# MANAGING A WINNING POSITION
Contrary to a losing position, **the key point in managing a winner...  
... is to let it run, best done by avoiding to touch it!**

The fact is that taking satisfactions is part of the human nature,
so it is very hard to look at a winner and be able to avoid taking profits,
but th ehard truth is that left alone many positions could take home many more profits.

The only proven strategy to make good returns is to lose little on losers 
and win big on winners, so the bigger you leave alone to run, the better.

Anyway, letting a winner turn into a loser without doing nothing would be double sad,
so it makes sense taking some profit out of the table,
with a disciplined approach that aims to let as much as possible run.  

## Objective of winner management
1. give a lot of weight to your best ideas, especially if they are winning;
2. let them run as much as you can, with as much weight as you dare;


### Winner management strategy
- **Position ABOVE 15-20%**  
  No time yet to take any profit.  
  It might instead make sense to INCREASE the position, if not yet of desired size.
  - the goal is to increase the position to make it full, 
    while keeping some margin of safety, at least 10% of GAIN.
    
- **Position ABOVE 50%**  
  check thesis and valuation, perfectly fine doing nothing or setting an 
  "upside maximiser" on a small part of the position.
  
- **Position ABOVE 100%** 
  check, re-balance under 20% of total assets, 
  potentially take 10-20% off.
  
- **Position ABOVE 200% and each next 100% increase**   
  re-balance position under 20%, take 10% off  
  ADD "SAVE PROFIT / UPSIDE MAXIMISER" @ 180-200% 
  for at least 30% of remaining position


### TODOs:
- [ ] GENERATE XL with scenarios of increasing winning positions
- [ ] GENERATE XL with scenarios of taking small profits on winners to let them run
