# MANAGING A LOSING POSITION
**The key point in managing a losing position is to actually manage it.**  
Too often people would prefer to just forget about it and do 
nothing, hoping it will somehow recover.

- Position below 15% review story, no action needed, but possible;

- Position below 20% review story, **action needed** 
  - (A) **CONTINUE POSITION**   
    ==> create order to bring the final position above -15%;   
    order must be entered for a price above -30% mark

  - (B) **CLOSE POSITION**  
    ==>  enter sale order
    
  - (C) **ATTEMPT REPAIR**  
    ==> if possible to work on the position to repair it.
