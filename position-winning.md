# MANAGING A WINNING POSITION
Contrary to a losing position, **the key point in managing a winner...  
... is to let it run, best done by avoiding to touch it!**

The fact is that taking satisfactions is part of the human nature,
so it is very hard to look at a winner and be able to avoid taking profits.

Letting a winner turning into a loser without doing nothing would be double sad,
so it makes sense taking some profit out of the table,
but with a disciplined approach that aims to let as much as possible run.  

## Profit taking strategy
- **Position ABOVE 15-20%**  
  No time yet to take any profit.  
  It might instead make sense to INCREASE the position, if not yet of desired size.
  - the goal is to increase the position to make it full, 
    while keeping some margin of safety, at least 10% of GAIN.
    
- **Position ABOVE 50%**  
  check thesis and valuation, perfectly fine doing nothing or setting an 
  "upside maximiser" on a small part of the position.
  
- **Position ABOVE 100%** 
  check, re-balance under 20% of total assets, 
  potentially take 10-20% off.
  
- **Position ABOVE 200% and each next 100% increase**   
  re-balance position under 20%, take 10% off  
  ADD "SAVE PROFIT / UPSIDE MAXIMISER" @ 180-200% 
  for at least 30% of remaining position
