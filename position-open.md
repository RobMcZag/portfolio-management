# Opening a position

Before we open a position we should do our research and analysis to understand 
the position we are going to open and have a plan for it.  
Then we need to start executing the trade, entering in the position. 

It consists of four main parts:

- ### WHY - the REASON to be in the position
  The WHY provides qualitative reasons to hold a position,
  explains the reasoning to hold the position, 
  and the expected evolution of the play.
  
  It usually boils down to:
    - a **position THESIS**   
    that explains why the position is interesting, and the expected evolution;
    
  - the **ROLE of the position**  
    what role the position plays in the portfolio, why we want to open it.   
    As an example the role can be one or more of the following:  
    - long term core for growth,
    - long term cone for dividend, 
    - long term speculation, 
    - hedge, 
    - short term speculation
      ...

- ### VALUATION - at what levels the position is interesting
  The VALUATION provides some OBJECTIVE measures to evaluate 
  if the position makes sense or not.  
  Interesting metrics are different depending on the case, 
  but some general ones might be present most of the times, like:
  - our estimated FAIR VALUE (as well as other FV),
  - multiples like P/E, P/S 
  - a target with its justification, if we have it  
    (ex AM with 1.23$ div would have ~ 15.3$ target to provide 8% yield)

- ### WHAT - what position we want to establish
  - **target position SIZE**, depending on the GOAL & VALUATION  
    This should reflect the conviction in the story, the risk and the role.
    
  - **position entry STRATEGY**, how to grow into a full position   
    e.g. 20% now + 20% in one month or at discount of -10% from entry price
    
  - **a REVIEW PERIOD**, how often the osition needs to be looked after;  
    Establish a review period based on GOAL, SIZE, expected market volatility
    
- ### Establishing a Position
  Once whe have the WHY, VALUATION and WHAT it is time to build the position;
  tasks include:
  - enter first ORDER 
  - what other ORDERS / ALERTS should we enter?  
    What strategy to use to get to a ful position?
    - sell PUT to buy lower or make a profit while waiting ? 
    - put next order already at what discount?
