# MANAGING A LOSING POSITION
**The key point in managing a losing position is to actually manage it.**  
Too often people would prefer to just forget about it and do 
nothing, hoping it will somehow recover.

## Objective of loser management
1. the main goal is to avoid permanent capital destruction,  
   by quitting soon enough lower conviction ideas gone south;
2. the next goal is to be able to turn a loser into a winner,  
   by deploying more capital at better condition for high conviction ideas. 

### Loser management strategy

- Position below 15% review story, no action needed, but possible;

- Position below 20% review story, **ACTION NEEDED** 
  - (A) **CONTINUE POSITION**   
    ==> create order to bring the final position above -15%;   
    order must be entered for a price above -30% mark

  - (B) **CLOSE POSITION**  
    ==>  enter sale order, take the loss and move on. 
    
  - (C) **ATTEMPT REPAIR**  
    ==> if possible to use the "Option stock position repair strategy" to work on 
    the position to repair it.  
    Update the position THESIS to reflect the new path.


### NOTES
- **Option stock position repair strategy**
  The repair strategy is built around an existing stock position, usually a stock 
  that is now trading at a lower price than the investor's original cost.   
  For every 100 shares held, 1 call option is purchased and 2 call options 
  with a higher strike price are sold, with all options having the same 
  expiration month. [CBOE - Equity option strategy](http://www.cboe.com/strategies/advanced/equity/stock-repairs-strategy/Part1)
