# Portfolio Management strategy & tools
Welcome to my repository for portfolio management strategy and tools.

# General phlosophy
- **DIVERSIFICATION lowers risck as well as returns**
  - Never put all your eggs in one basket, that's too risky.
  - Do not dilute your best ideas, so much that they will not contribute meaningfully
  
- **CONCENTRATION requires deep analysis and constant monitoring.**
  - Only very strong conviction ideas should ever go above 10% of assets
  - Everything that is above 10% should be monitored (at least weekly) and possibly alerted for big moves.

- **MANAGE loosers, LET ALONE winners**
  - When you are down 20% there is no more room for waiting / inaction:
    either you recognise you were wrong and you sell
    or you recognise you have a wonderful bargaing and you buy more.
  - When you are up 50% or more it becomes hard not to take profits, for fear of loosing them.
    If the story is still positive and valuation not stretched, let it run, 
    eventually taking a bit of profit when you start be over 100%
