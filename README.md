# Roberto's Portfolio Management strategy & tools
Welcome to my repository for portfolio management strategy and tools.

# General philosophy
- **DIVERSIFICATION lowers risck as well as returns**
  - Never put all your eggs in one basket, that's too risky, but
  - Do not dilute your best ideas, or they will not contribute meaningfully.
  

- **CONCENTRATION requires deep analysis and constant monitoring.**
  - Only very strong conviction ideas should ever go above 10% of assets
  - Everything that is above 10% should be monitored (at least weekly) and possibly alerted for big moves.


- **MANAGE loosers, LET ALONE winners**
  - When you are down 20% there is no more room for waiting / inaction:
    either you recognise you were wrong and you sell
    or you recognise you have a wonderful bargaing and you buy more.
  - When you are up 50% or more it becomes hard not to take profits, for fear of loosing them.
    If the story is still positive and valuation not stretched, let it run, 
    eventually taking a bit of profit when you start be over 100%
    
# Portfolio management
- ## [Position sizing](position-sizing.md)  
  Keeping a balance between concentrating on top ideas / sectors while managing risk
  and avoiding market timing.


- ## Position management
  Statistics say that stock prices move close to random,
  and that even the best investors are right about 50% of the times.
  So after opening a position it will be normal to manage both winners and losers!  
  
  The main activities are:
  - [opening a position]((position-open.md))
  - [managing a loosing position](position-losing.md)
  - [managing a winning position](position-winning.md)
