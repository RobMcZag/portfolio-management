Welcome to my repository for portfolio management strategy and tools.

# General phlosophy
- **DIVERSIFICATION lowers risck as well as returns**
  - Never put all your eggs in one basket, that's too risky.
  - Do not dilute your best ideas, so much that they will not contribute meaningfully
  
- **CONCENTRATION requires deep analysis and constant monitoring.**
  - Only very strong conviction ideas should ever go above 10% of assets
  - Everything that is above 10% should be monitored (at least weekly) and possibly alerted for big moves.

- **MANAGE loosers, LET ALONE winners**
  - When you are down 20% there is no more room for waiting / inaction:
    either you recognise you were wrong and you sell
    or you recognise you have a wonderful bargaing and you buy more.
  - When you are up 50% or more it becomes hard not to take profits, for fear of loosing them.
    If the story is still positive and valuation not stretched, let it run, 
    eventually taking a bit of profit when you start be over 100%
    
# POSITION SIZING 
- At least 12, preferably 24, months of funds should be in defensive assets easy to liquid. 
  Things like cash, near term safe bonds, deposit accounts, ... 
  and eventually for the amount past the first 12 mouths: gold or hedges.
  
- **SECTOR CONCENTRATION** should be under 30% of all assets (including defensive assets).
  To go over 30% requires special justification, constant monitoring & eventually hedging.
  
- **SECURITY CONCENTRATION** should be under 20% of all assets. 
  You should consider all "related" securities, e.g. AM & AR are strictly related 
  and we could consider NG (natural gas) to be closely related too
