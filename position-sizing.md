# POSITION SIZING

- **KEEP CASH AT HAND**  
  Keep **at least 12, preferably 24, months of funds** 
  in defensive assets that are easy to liquidate.   
    - assets like cash, near term safe bonds, deposit accounts are perfect 
      for this function, even if their return is now pretty low;  
    - you can hold other assets like gold or hedges related to your main positions
      to increase the amount beyond the first 12 / 24 months
  - Goals of having some cash at hand:
    - **Avoid the need to divest on short notice** to cover for needs.  
      Markets go up and down, generally slowing grinding up over years,
      but when they go down they can go down quickly and deeply,
      taking many months or years to regain previous heights;
      we want to avoid the need to sell when they are down,
      especially when they are down a lot.
    - **Have cash ready to deploy when prices are low**  
      If you keep more than minimum cash at hand to cover for needs,
      you can use this extra "dry power" to deploy it when prices 
      hae gone down significantly. Be able to buy "on sale".


- **SECTOR CONCENTRATION** 
  - should be **under 30% of all assets** (including defensive assets).  
  - to go over 30% requires special justification, constant monitoring & eventually hedging.
  

- **SECURITY CONCENTRATION** 
  - should be **under 20% of all assets** considering all "related" securities,  
    e.g. AM & AR are strictly related, and we could consider NG (natural gas) 
    to be closely related too, as revenue and performance of AM and AR,
    including market appreciation of them, are closely related to NG futures.
