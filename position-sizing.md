# POSITION SIZING

- **Avoid the need to divest on short notice**  
  Markets go up and down, generally more up than down, but when they go down 
  they can go down quickly and deeply, and we want to avoid the need to sell 
  when they are down, especially close to the bottom.  
  - **Keep enough defensive assets that are easy to liquidate:** 
  at least 12, preferably 24, months of funds   
    - assets like cash, near term safe bonds, deposit accounts are perfect 
      for this function, even if their return is now pretty low;  
    - to cover the amount beyond the first 12 months you can hold other assets 
      like gold or hedges related to your main positions
  
  
- **SECTOR CONCENTRATION** 
  - should be **under 30% of all assets** (including defensive assets).  
  - to go over 30% requires special justification, constant monitoring & eventually hedging.
  

- **SECURITY CONCENTRATION** 
  - should be **under 20% of all assets** considering all "related" securities,  
    e.g. AM & AR are strictly related, and we could consider NG (natural gas) 
    to be closely related too, as revenue and performance of AM and AR,
    including market appreciation of them, are closely related to NG futures.
