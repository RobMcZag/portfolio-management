# POSITION SIZING

- At least 12, preferably 24, months of funds should be in defensive assets easy to liquid. 
  Things like cash, near term safe bonds, deposit accounts, ... 
  and eventually for the amount past the first 12 mouths: gold or hedges.
  
- **SECTOR CONCENTRATION** should be under 30% of all assets (including defensive assets).
  To go over 30% requires special justification, constant monitoring & eventually hedging.
  
- **SECURITY CONCENTRATION** should be under 20% of all assets. 
  You should consider all "related" securities, e.g. AM & AR are strictly related 
  and we could consider NG (natural gas) to be closely related too
